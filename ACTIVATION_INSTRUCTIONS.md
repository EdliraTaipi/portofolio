### 2. Activate the Form
- Open the FormSubmit activation email
- Click the **activation link** inside
- You'll see a confirmation page

### 3. Test After Activation
- Submit a test message through your contact form
- Check both inbox and spam for the message
- After activation, future emails should arrive in your inbox

## Alternative: Force New Activation

1. Go to: https://formsubmit.co/edlira.taipi@hotmail.com
2. Submit a simple test form manually
3. This will trigger a new activation email
