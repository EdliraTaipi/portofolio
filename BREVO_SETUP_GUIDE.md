# Brevo Email Sender Validation Guide

## Issue Identified
Brevo SMTP is rejecting emails because the sender address `9320ea001@smtp-brevo.com` is not validated in your Brevo account.

## Solution Options:

### Option 1: Validate Your Email in Brevo (Recommended)
1. **Log into your Brevo account**
2. **Go to Senders & IP settings**
3. **Add edlira.taipi@hotmail.com as a validated sender**
4. **Verify the email** by clicking the confirmation link sent to your Hotmail
5. **Update the system** to use your validated email

### Option 2: Use Domain Authentication
1. **Add your domain to Brevo** (if you have one)
2. **Set up SPF and DKIM records** in your domain DNS
3. **Validate the domain** in Brevo settings
4. **Use domain email** as sender (e.g., contact@yourdomain.com)

### Option 3: Keep Current Working System
Your FormSubmit integration is working perfectly:
- ✅ Messages save to database
